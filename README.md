# DiA-dynMap
A dynamic map for the Dungeons and Dragons module "Baldur's Gate - Descent into Avernus"

This web application animates a map of the First Layer of Hell, in accordance with the [Alexandrian Remix](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/44214/roleplaying-games/remixing-avernus), by Justin Alexander.

# How it works
The map works based on a hexcrawl structure. The Alexandrian covers the subject extensively on [his blog](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/46020/roleplaying-games/5e-hexcrawl) but in a nutshell it is a game structure optimised for open world, exploration-based scenarios.

This app tries to help the DM (and possibly the players) visualize the information by providing a comprehensive and quickly accessible overview of the entire gaming area.

# The application
The Alexandrian did a brilliant job writing the description of each location, creating a consistent worldbuilding and coming up with the structure itself. However, the way the information is presented to the user is (in my opinion, of course) a bit fragmentated and inconvenient to look at, especially during prep time. This is where DiA-dynMap comes into play!

The app prints a grid of semi-transparent hexagons on the postermap of Avernus, adding a name label to each location. Additionally, it's possible to click on a hexagon opening a new page detailing the entire key written by The Alexandrian plus a handy reference for any notable item (I.E. dream machine components) present and the type of terrain featured by the hex.

It is also possible to swap the background map with a simplified one which shows the type of terrain featured by every hex.
