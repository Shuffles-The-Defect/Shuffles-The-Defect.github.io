    title: "Collapsed Building",
    text: `
    <p>A quake rocks the city, and a building collapses in the distance. The characters hear cries for help emerging from the rubble.</p>
    <p>To keep the trapped victims from suffocating or being crushed, the characters must succeed on a total of six ability checks to rescue them before incurring three failures. The base DC for these checks is 10. Possible checks could include Strength (Athletics) checks to remove debris, Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to squeeze into tight places, Intelligence (Investigation) checks to determine the best place to dig or support the structure, or Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice dangerous areas threatening to collapse further. You might also decide that magic or other abilities could result in automatic successes.</p>
    <p>During the rescue, the commotion might attract devils (see "Hateful Patrol" below) or other unwelcome attention.</p>
    <p>If the characters succeed in the rescue attempt, they pull out three lawful good shield dwarves from beneath the collapsed building: Strovin Ironfist, Kartra Boulderstern, and Velkora Ashenwell. Strovin and Kartra are laborers (use the commoner stat block), but Velkora is a mason and an acolyte of the dwarven god Moradin. Her healing powers would be a welcome resource at the High Hall. All three dwarves speak Common and Dwarvish, and have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. They also have resistance to poison damage and advantage on saving throws against being poisoned.</p>

    <p>The characters hear a voice shouting for help. If they follow the voice, they find a male human under attack by two bulezau (see page 230 for their stat block) that slipped past the devils and climbed the infernal binding posts to Elturel.</p>
    <p>If the characters save the man, he introduces himself as Orin Ragron, a blacksmith who had a shop in Elturel. Orin is actually an incubus in disguise named Faltrax. The incubus is trying to gain information on the defenses of Elturel, which it then plans to sell to the highest fiendish bidder. If the characters discover Faltrax's true nature, the incubus flees.</p>

If the characters enter the residence, they see four ghasts standing around a table eating the remains of a human family that perished here during the trip to Avernus. The ghasts reek of death and decay.</p>
    <p>When the ghasts are dealt with, a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns a faint crying coming from a cupboard. Inside is a young girl called Shorah Hevrun. A noncombatant, she immediately attaches herself to the first character who is kind to her. Shorah insists on accompanying the characters until she feels safe. If they can get her to the High Hall, each character gains inspiration, and the survivors there can see to Shorah's care.</p>

    title: "Imp Sales Pitch",
    text: `
        <p>As the characters pass an alleyway, they notice an imp talking with a halfling. The two are focused on each other, making it easy for characters to get close enough to overhear the conversation in Common. The halfling, a baker (commoner) named Pilster Pebblehuck, has been hiding with his family in the basement of their bakery. They are running out of food, so Pilster has braved the streets to search for provisions. The imp, Perchillux, is offering Pilster a month's worth of food for the low price of his soul. Pilster is preparing to sign the contract as the characters come upon the pair.</p>
        <p>The contract is written on parchment made of halfling skin. If any character interrupts the signing and asks to read the contract, the imp tells them this is none of their business. Pilster welcomes the interruption, however, since he is having second thoughts about the deal, and he hands the contract to the characters. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check penetrates the dense and convoluted text of the contract, which will give the imp the souls of Pilster's entire family if Pilster signs it.</p>
        <p>If the characters attack the imp, it turns invisible and attempts to escape as quickly as possible. If the characters save Pilster from selling his soul, he thanks the characters and begs them to get him and his family to safety. His wife, Merrywile, and their three children are nearby.</p>
        <p><strong>Treasure:</strong> In addition to the contract, the imp carries a soul coin (see page 225) from a previous interaction that it plans to give to its master.</p>

    <p>A vrock fled the battle and flew up to the city to ponder its role in all things. As long as the characters leave it alone, it doesn't attack. If they approach, it speaks with them, using its telepathy to communicate with one character at a time if none of the characters speaks Abyssal. The vrock pontificates on the vagaries and possible meanings of existence.</p>
<p>If the characters treat it nicely, indulge it in its ponderings, and succeed on a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check, they can get it to do them one small favor. If they attack it, the vrock repays their hostility in kind.</p>
<p>Favors from the vrock might include providing information about what's happening beneath the city, about what forces guard the bridges between the city's east and west sections, or about the demons' plan to use a portal to enter the city (see area Gl2 on page 69), although it doesn't know where that portal is.</p>

            <p>Alta Tron, a chaotic neutral female human enchanter (see appendix A), approaches the characters, introducing herself as a mystical engineer and claiming to have developed a device that can allow a group safe passage across the rift separating the east and west sides of the city. If the characters agree to help Alta successfully test the device, she agrees to build the characters one for their own.</p>
            <p>Though extremely skilled, the engineer is a bit mad and suffers from bouts of delusions of grandeur. A successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check notices something a bit off about her.</p>
            <p>The device is intended to create an invisible bridge across the rift that lasts for five minutes. Examination of the rune-covered metallic device reveals no useful information, as there is no way of surmising how it was built.</p>
            <h4>The Experiment</h4>
            <p>When activated, the device indeed creates a magical bridge that cannot be seen by any means other than with truesight. The bridge, unknowingly to the party, extends only 50 feet across. A character crossing the bridge must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to notice. In addition, after five rounds, the bridge begins to collapse. A successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check notices small wisps of smoke coming out of the machine, while a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check discovers there are only moments left before the device fails. Characters on the bridge when the device begins to fail can rush back to solid ground with a successful DC 14 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.</p>
            <p>Characters that fail and cannot fly, levitate, or teleport fall several hundred feet into the River Styx (see chapter 3 of Baldur’s Gate: Descent into Avernus).</p>

    <p>Opportunistic, independent devils raiding Elturel before its ultimate destruction could be independent operators (like the chain devil described above) or used as foreshadowing of the Avernian Warlords (see <a href="https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/46667/roleplaying-games/remixing-avernus-part-7f-warlords-of-avernus">Part 7E</a>).</p>
    
    <h3>Hell Knights</h3>
    <p>These encounters can establish that the High Knights transformed into the Hell Knights; the destruction of high-level spellcasters; and/or the continued corruption of the Hellriders and Order of the Companion. (Recommendations for Hell Knight stats are given in <a href="https://thealexandrian.net/?p=46787">Part 7G</a>.)</p>
    
    <h3>Zarielite Cultists</h3>
    <p>Highlight that many of these cultists came to Elturel as a sort of pilgrimage AND that the Elturian government has been riddled with Zarielites for decades. They’re mostly just reveling now, but questioning them can fill in a lot of gaps about how Elturel fell and also what’s been happening here since the city arrived in Hell.</p>
    
    <h3>Ikaia’s Followers</h3>
    <p>Not all of whom need be his Sons or Daughters; there are a number of humans who have more less pledged fealty to someone who they feel can protect them in the midst of all this insanity. These encounters are most likely to happen in the east side of the city.</p>
    
    <h3>Ravengard’s Peacekeepers</h3>
    <p>Should probably give the sense that they are overwhelmed, but trying hard. More likely to be encountered in the west side of the city, but if encountered in the east are likely to be overwhelmed (cut off from their comrades when Torm’s Bridges were taken).</p>
    
    <h3>Liashandra’s Demons</h3>
    <p>This faction primarily exists to justify using demon stat blocks in Hell, but you do have some opportunity to establish the larger planar-political situation of the Blood War and the motives behind Zariel’s Elturian recruitment drive. There’s also a slim opportunity for some enemy-of-my-enemy action, as Liashandra’s primary mission is to sabotage the Fall of Elturel, so feel free to tack in that direction for demonic encounters.</p>
